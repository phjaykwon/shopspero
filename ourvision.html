	 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSpero is an online collection of vintage and thrifted clothing and accessories. We also showcase featured artists and their original artwork. Spero has partnered with multiple charities and 20% of all proceeds will go to orphanages around the world. <br />
	 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn Latin, the word “spero” means “to hope”. Spero is the collision of fashion and mission. Our vision is also inspired by Matthew 10:29-31, where something as insignificant as a sparrow, will be remembered and cared for. We want to expose the poverty in these neglected nations through an innovative medium. <br />
	 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe goal of Spero is to bring hope to the hopeless and light into darkness. Spero is the 21st century means of bridging the fashion industry and missions field.
