		<h3>Our Vision</h3>
		<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spero is an online collection of vintage and thrifted clothing and accessories. We also showcase featured artists and their original artwork. Spero has partnered with multiple charities and 20% of all proceeds will go to orphanages around the world. 
		<br>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Latin, the word “spero” means “to hope”. Spero is the collision of fashion and mission. Our vision is also inspired by Matthew 10:29-31, where something as insignificant as a sparrow, will be remembered and cared for. We want to expose the poverty in these neglected nations through an innovative medium. 
	 <br>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of Spero is to bring hope to the hopeless and light into darkness. Spero is the 21st century means of bridging the fashion industry and missions field.

        <p class="member-bio">Born and raised in sunny San Diego but now attending college in the Bay Area, Jennifer has been able to experience both sides of California. When she's not cramming for midterms, Jennifer enjoys exploring her creative side - baking, knitting, designing, decorating, creating, you name it! If you ever want to shower her with love, don't buy her flowers - buy her a cactus. As she fumbles her way through life, growing and figuring out her passions and path, she hopes that Spero would likewise refine and become a source of hope to many. </p>

        <br>
        <p class="member-bio">Elsie loves long walks to Chipotle, the sound of laughter, and yellow Gatorade. She dreams of the intellectual coffee talks, hectic morning commutes, and relationships she will find in being in the world of business and law (I promise that I know what I am getting myself into). She is incredibly humbled by the vision of Spero and she cannot wait to see how God will connect dreams, build hope, and move hearts with this project. Watch out, Berkeley, big things are happening! </p>

        <br>
        <p class="member-bio">Alyssa is a student at UC Berkeley studying Integrative Biology and Spanish language. To escape the stresses that come with being a student on the pre-med track, Alyssa likes to step back and look at the world from behind the lens. Pictures make her happy, as do her friends, family, singing, eating, and everything of the like. She is pretty affectionate, almost to the point where people get uncomfortable but what can she do? She just has a childlike spirit that loves to express itself. Helping people is what she loves to do, and she can't wait to work with the beloved Spero team. </p>
